# friend-finder
Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers

The purpose of this assignment was to make an app that helps you find friend, by matching up the person in which you have the most in common.  

The matching is acheived by calculating the difference between your answers and that of the potential matches, and the one with the lowest difference in scores is your match.  

But what happens if my answers only match me with me?  Not to worry, state of the art algorithm's prevent that from happening.
